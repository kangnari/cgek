UCB STC web app competition, 2014

Although UC Berkeley offers mental health services to students, students are often reluctant to reach out due to personal qualms and fear of social stigma.

Cal@Heart is a growing online community focused on developing emotional wellbeing and confidence at Cal. We aim to provide users with an environment that fosters open communication. Users may create profiles and post anonymously about personal issues in a safe virtual space. They may also respond to other usersâ€™ posts with encouragement and/or advice. Upcoming features include anonymous private messaging between users and video testimonials.
